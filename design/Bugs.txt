(1)  Fixed : We created over 6 thouands steps, then using the search window
after selecting an item in the search result list we get the next error

===========================================================
(3) Fixed : During some tests, I discovered bad steps order in the search window
===========================================================
(4) Fixed : Trying paste many times lead to runtime error
The problem is related to triggering this event during another event execution
	setValueChangedEvent(Method(:ChangeTimeMachinePointAction))
Solution: Save the event, remove it, change value then set it again.
		cEvent = getValueChangedEvent()
		setValueChangedEvent("")
		setValue(nInteractionPoints)
		setValueChangedEvent(cEvent)
===========================================================
(5) Fixed : Open search window, display all steps, go to the past using the time machine
select a step in the future from the search window

(6) Fixed : Error after using paste then the time machine
Go to the past and use paste, then go to the future (present)  and move backward
Also the same error happens when we add steps in the past
then then go to the future (present) and move backward

(8) Fixed : Bad Order of steps after paste and new steps operations in the paste
The problem is inside 	func FindNewNodePosition in TreeModel.ring
How to reproduce the bug?
	Create one two three steps
	goto the past where we have one only
	Select one copy and paste many times
	select one create new steps ok ok
	open search window, display all steps
	you will see ok ok before nested one 

The problem is solved by maintaining a parent list

	func FindNewNodePosition nParent
		for x = 1 to len(aList) {
			if aList[x][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID] = nParent {
				aParentList = [nParent]
				for x2 = x+1 to len(aList) {
					if find(aParentList,aList[x2][C_TREEMODEL_PARENTID]) = 0 {
						return x2-1
					else
						aParentList + aList[x2][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID]
					}
				}
			}
		}
		return len(aList)

(9) Fixed : During Move Up Opeartion

Line 180 Error (R2) : Array Access (Index out of range) !
In method children() in file goaldesigner/model/treemodel.ring
called from line 180  In method getchildren() in file goaldesigner/model/treemodel.ring
called from line 180  In method movenodeup() in file goaldesigner/model/treemodel.ring

called from line 46  In function test_goaldesigner() in file B:/pwct2/goaldesigner.ring
called from line 39  in file B:/pwct2/goaldesigner.ring

To reproduce the bug
	* Create one two three steps
	* move three up and two down to have three two one
	* use the time machine backward and forward
	* this lead to one two three (another bug in the order by time machine)
	* select three then click move up - you get the error message

The problem is Fixed by this check : if nPos = 0 { return }

	func MoveNodeUp nNodeID
		# Find the sibling node (Up)
			nPos = SiblingUp(nNodeID)
		# Check if we don't have nodes Up
			if nPos = 0 { return }
===========================================================
(10) Fixed :  After using Move Up/Down then the time machine we get bad order
To reproduce the bug
	* Create one two three steps
	* move three up and one down so we have three two one
	* use the time mahcine backward then forward you get one two three !

Fixed by using this function

	func CheckInsertStep oView,oModel,nParentID,nStepID,nStepIID
		# Get the Next step after this step
			nPos = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.SiblingDown(nStepID)
		if nPos != 0 {
			nStepID2 = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.GetData()[nPos][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID]
			nStepIID2 = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.GetData()[nPos][C_TREEMODEL_CONTENT][:interactionid]
			if nStepIID2 < nStepIID  { # The next Step is visible  
					oItem = oView.oStepsTree.GetObjByID(nStepID2)
					nIndex = oItem.parent().indexofchild(oItem)
					nIndex++	 	# Start from 1 not 0
					return nIndex 	# True and the Item Index
			}
		}
		return False
