(1)  Fixed : We created over 6 thouands steps, then using the search window
after selecting an item in the search result list we get the next error

===========================================================================================================================
(3) Fixed : During some tests, I discovered bad steps order in the search window
===========================================================================================================================
(4) Fixed : Trying paste many times lead to runtime error
The problem is related to triggering this event during another event execution
	setValueChangedEvent(Method(:ChangeTimeMachinePointAction))
Solution: Save the event, remove it, change value then set it again.
		cEvent = getValueChangedEvent()
		setValueChangedEvent("")
		setValue(nInteractionPoints)
		setValueChangedEvent(cEvent)
===========================================================================================================================
(5) Fixed : Open search window, display all steps, go to the past using the time machine
select a step in the future from the search window

(6) Fixed : Error after using paste then the time machine
Go to the past and use paste, then go to the future (present)  and move backward
Also the same error happens when we add steps in the past
then then go to the future (present) and move backward

(8) Fixed : Bad Order of steps after paste and new steps operations in the paste
The problem is inside 	func FindNewNodePosition in TreeModel.ring
How to reproduce the bug?
	Create one two three steps
	goto the past where we have one only
	Select one copy and paste many times
	select one create new steps ok ok
	open search window, display all steps
	you will see ok ok before nested one 

The problem is solved by maintaining a parent list

	func FindNewNodePosition nParent
		for x = 1 to len(aList) {
			if aList[x][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID] = nParent {
				aParentList = [nParent]
				for x2 = x+1 to len(aList) {
					if find(aParentList,aList[x2][C_TREEMODEL_PARENTID]) = 0 {
						return x2-1
					else
						aParentList + aList[x2][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID]
					}
				}
			}
		}
		return len(aList)

(9) Fixed : During Move Up Opeartion

Line 180 Error (R2) : Array Access (Index out of range) !
In method children() in file goaldesigner/model/treemodel.ring
called from line 180  In method getchildren() in file goaldesigner/model/treemodel.ring
called from line 180  In method movenodeup() in file goaldesigner/model/treemodel.ring

called from line 46  In function test_goaldesigner() in file B:/pwct2/goaldesigner.ring
called from line 39  in file B:/pwct2/goaldesigner.ring

To reproduce the bug
	* Create one two three steps
	* move three up and two down to have three two one
	* use the time machine backward and forward
	* this lead to one two three (another bug in the order by time machine)
	* select three then click move up - you get the error message

The problem is Fixed by this check : if nPos = 0 { return }

	func MoveNodeUp nNodeID
		# Find the sibling node (Up)
			nPos = SiblingUp(nNodeID)
		# Check if we don't have nodes Up
			if nPos = 0 { return }
===========================================================================================================================
(10) Fixed :  After using Move Up/Down then the time machine we get bad order
To reproduce the bug
	* Create one two three steps
	* move three up and one down so we have three two one
	* use the time mahcine backward then forward you get one two three !

Fixed by using this function

	func CheckInsertStep oView,oModel,nParentID,nStepID,nStepIID
		# Get the Next step after this step
			nPos = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.SiblingDown(nStepID)
		if nPos != 0 {
			nStepID2 = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.GetData()[nPos][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID]
			nStepIID2 = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.GetData()[nPos][C_TREEMODEL_CONTENT][:interactionid]
			if nStepIID2 < nStepIID  { # The next Step is visible  
					oItem = oView.oStepsTree.GetObjByID(nStepID2)
					nIndex = oItem.parent().indexofchild(oItem)
					nIndex++	 	# Start from 1 not 0
					return nIndex 	# True and the Item Index
			}
		}
		return False

(26) Fixed : 

Open files from project explorer
Then close the opened file
Then click on the open file from the toolbar 
Lead to crash

The reason is that when we open file using project explorer we set it as the active file
And the toolbar use the active object (controller) behind this file
Closing the file, delete the controller object so we have the crash

Solution when a file is closed we have to change the active file 

Solved by avoiding the destroy to windows when we close dockable widgets

The problem is finding the Interaction record when we copy steps from a file
Then trying to paste in another file that doesn't contains the interaction data 

Solved by using the InteractionBuffer object 
Where we copy the interactions data when we copy steps 


===========================================================================================================================
(31) Fixed

The problem happens when we Cut --> Paste()
But Copy ---> Paste - no problem 
Also Copy ---> Cut ---> Paste - No Problem
It's related to missing date when we cut 
This data is not missing in Copy operation

(36) Fixed 

Move up - conflict with the time machine 
When we go back then to the present
we see the step down (not up as expected !)

Create four steps ( one - two - three - four )
move the step (four) to be before (one) so we have
four 
one 
two 
three 
Until now no problem in the time machine 
Now create another four steps (Print one - print two - print three - print four)
move (print four) to be up so we have 
four 
print four 
one 
two 
three 
print one
print two 
print three 
now go back using the time machine then go forward 
we have 
print four 
one 
two 
three 
four 	-------> wrong place !!!
print one 
print two 
print three 

Solved using in next function by adding the loop (While True)


	func CheckInsertStep oView,oModel,nParentID,nStepID,nStepIID
		while True {	# We will repeat the process until we find a visible step after this step 
			# Get the Next step after this step
				nPos = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.SiblingDown(nStepID)
			if nPos != 0 {
				nStepID2 = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.GetData()[nPos][C_TREEMODEL_NODEID]
				nStepIID2 = oModel.oStepsTreeModel.GetData()[nPos][C_TREEMODEL_CONTENT][:interactionid]
				if nStepIID2 < nStepIID  { # The next Step is visible  
						oItem = oView.oStepsTree.GetObjByID(nStepID2)
						nIndex = oItem.parent().indexofchild(oItem)
						nIndex++	 	# Start from 1 not 0
						return nIndex 	# True and the Item Index
				else 	# The step is not visible - we need what after it 
					# Use the unvisible step as the current step

(37) Fixed 

The files manager - open a file then click to open it again
The file will be opened again ! instead of displaying the opened one!

Fixed in environmentController.ring - openvisualFile() method using the next code 

			aActiveFilesCopy = aActiveFiles 
			for item in aActiveFilesCopy { item[2] = lower(item[2]) }

performance problem in using Qt SQLite

Solved by replacing the next code 

			while movenext() {		
				aRow = list(nMax)	
				for x = 1 to nMax {
					aRow[x] = [
						aRecord[x],
						value(x-1).tostring()
					]
				}
				aResult + aRow
			}

with the next code 

			query = this.query
			while movenext() {		
				aRow = list(nMax)	
				for x = 1 to nMax {
					aRow[x] = [
						aRecord[x],
						qvariant_tostring(qsqlquery_value(query.pObject,x-1))
					]
				}
				aResult + aRow

(39) Fixed

PWCT - change form files
	each time I change between two files
		the loading time ---> increase
		memory usage ---> increase 
	[Performance+Memory] problem

It's a Qt problem
The problem in this line

		oDesigner.oModel.FormObject() {
		 	setBackColor(itemdata[:backcolor])		# here

	Setting the backcolor of the form again lead to this problem !

I solved the problem by closing the current form, creating new form from scratch when we open new forms

	func DeleteAllObjectsFromModel oDesigner
		oDesigner.oModel.DeleteAllObjects()
		oDesigner.AddObjectsToCombo()
		oDesigner.AddObjectProperties()

	func LoadFormFromFile oDesigner
		# Disable Updates 
			oDesigner.oView.oSub.setupdatesenabled(False)
			oDesigner.oView.oSub.blocksignals(True)
		# Delete objects
			DeleteAllObjectsFromModel(oDesigner)
		# Create New Form 
			CreateNewForm(oDesigner)
		# Load the Form Data
			eval(read(cFileName))
		# Create Objects
			CreateFormObjects(oDesigner,aObjectsList)
		# Enable Updates
			oDesigner.oView.oSub.setupdatesenabled(True)
			oDesigner.oView.oSub.blocksignals(False)


	func CreateNewForm oDesigner
		# Close the form 
			oDesigner.oModel.FormObject().close()

		# Update the Model 
			oDesigner.oModel.aObjectsList = []

		# Create the form
			oDesigner.oModel.AddObject("Window",
				 new FormDesigner_qWidget() { hide() }
			)

		# Create the Select/Draw Label
			oDesigner.oView.oLabelSelect = new qlabel(oDesigner.oModel.FormObject()) {
				setGeometry(100,100,400,400)
		 		setstylesheet("background-color:rgba(50,150,255,0.3);border: 1px solid black")
				setautoFillBackground(false)
				settext("")
				setmousetracking(false)
				hide()
			}

		# Add the form to the Sub Window
			oDesigner.oView.oSub {
				setwidget(oDesigner.oModel.FormObject())
				oDesigner.oModel.ActiveObject().setSubWindow(oDesigner.oView.oSub)
			}

(40) Fixed : memory leak when we open the visual source files in the same window 

Solved in environmentcontroller.ring  method : openvisualFile()

		# If we open one file each time, clear the aActiveFiles list 
			if not lOpenFilesInNewTabs {
				aActiveFiles = []
			}

This was a logical memory leak!

(43) Fixed : Testing on Mobile Devices lead to two problems  (2020.01.03) 

	* When the window contains a timer 
		Closing the window doesn't stop the timer 

		This happens in Qt 5.12 (not Qt 5.5)

	Solutions 

		(1) Stop the timer before closing the window 
			---> Bad solution because it need updating the application code 

		(2) Delete the window object after closing it 
			---> Nice solution because it could be done at the library level 
				 Without the need to update the application code 

	* When opening and closing a window many times 
			around 250 times (Yes I did this strange test to trigger the bug!)
		This will lead to a bug in Qt itself ---> Then Crash 

	Solutions 

		(1) Delete the window object after closing it

(44) Fixed: Unstable version of PWCT for WebAssembly after using Ring 1.14
	It was because this version of Ring produce runtime error
	At some situations when we convert (String to Number)
	And we have a NULL string

	I got different shapes of errors like


	Line 198 Error (R41) : Invalid numeric string qtloader.js:372:25
	In method selectstep() in file B:\pwct2\goaldesigner\controller/goaldesignercontroller.ring qtloader.js:372:25
	called from line 119  In method selectstep() in file B:\pwct2\component\controller/componentcontrollerparent.ring qtloader.js:372:25
	called from line 69  In method newstep() in file B:\pwct2\component\controller/componentcontrollerparent.ring qtloader.js:372:25
	called from line 22  In method generateaction() in file B:\pwct2\vpl\ringpwct\print.ring qtloader.js:372:25

	called from line 11572  In qapp_exec() In method exec() in file b:\ring\libraries\guilib\classes/ring_qt.ring qtloader.js:372:25
	called from line 30  In function startenvironment() in file B:\pwct2\environment/environment.ring

	Which lead to more serious errors like
		Assertion failed: pList != NULL, at: ..\qtproject/ring/src/ring_vmstackvars.c,328,ring_vm_list_copy
	And
		Assertion failed: pList != NULL, at: ..\qtproject/ring/src/ring_list.c,249,ring_list_getitem


	Solution

	I did an update in PWCT to check for (-1) instead of (NULL)

	This code 
		func NewParentStep cStep
			# some code here
			if nStepID != NULL {
				EditStepName(cStepName,nStepID)
				return
			}

	Changed to

			if nStepID != -1 {
				EditStepName(cStepName,nStepID)
				return
			}

	And the same for this code

		func SelectStep nIID,nStepNumber
			nStepID = oModel.GetStepIDbyIID(nIID,nStepNumber)
			oItem = NULL
			if nStepID != NULL {
				oItem = oView.oStepsTree.GetObjByID(nStepID)
			}
			return [oItem,nStepID]

	Changed to 

			if nStepID != -1 {
				oItem = oView.oStepsTree.GetObjByID(nStepID)
			}

	And this function
		func GetStepIDbyIID nIID,nStepNumber
		aList = oStepsTreeModel.GetData()
		for x = len(aList) to 1 step -1 {
			item = aList[x]
			if  item[C_TREEMODEL_CONTENT][:interactionid] = nIID and
  			    item[C_TREEMODEL_CONTENT][:stepNumber] = nStepNumber {
				return item[C_TREEMODEL_NODEID]
			}
		}

	Now includes
		return -1	# In the end when the item doesn't exist
	
	In the future I will update Ring itself to pass this error
	When we convert NULL to a NUMBER 

	Update: The original problem fixed in Ring itself

(45) Fixed: Changing the Style doesn't apply it to the Steps Tree
	Try Ctrl+Shift+3 then Ctrol+Shift+4

	The problem was in using UseArabic() many times
	And this function uses Eval() and reload the Settings file

	Solved In this commit by using lUseArabic flag 
		https://github.com/MahmoudFayed/pwct2/commit/5293b1fd33411c2b23d4ffd360dec51b229e3e96

===========================================================================================================================

(46) Fixed: When using the Import Tool (Ring2PWCT) I got the next error 
	after converting some apps 

		Literal Not Closed

	A little test was using 
		print("test" + x + "','")
	Where we get the next step in the visual source file
		print("test" + x + ',')
	i.e. a missing " " around ','

	Solved by changing 	

	func AddToTextBuffer 
		if Find([C_LITERAL,C_NUMBER,C_OPERATOR,C_IDENTIFIER],nTokenType) {
			if nTokenType = C_LITERAL {
				cTokenValue = ValueAsString(cTokenValue)
			}
	 		cBuffer += cTokenValue
		}

	To

	func AddToTextBuffer 
		if Find([C_LITERAL,C_NUMBER,C_OPERATOR,C_IDENTIFIER],nTokenType) {
			cTokenValue2 = cTokenValue
			if nTokenType = C_LITERAL {
				cTokenValue2 = ValueAsString(cTokenValue)
			}
	 		cBuffer += cTokenValue2
		}

	Where we use cTokenValue2 instead of updating cTokenValue 

	Because the Parser call ValueAsString() two times! 
	And updating the Token Value lead to a bug 
	In the past I worked around it in

	func ValueAsString cValue
		# Check if we have "string" or 'string' or `string`
			cValue2 = trim(cValue)
			if len(cValue2) > 1
				if cValue2[1] = '"' or cValue2[1] = "'" or cValue2[1] = "`"
					return cValue
				ok
			ok
		# Add " " or ' ' or ` `
			if substr(cValue,'"') = 0 {
				cChar = '"'
			elseif substr(cValue,"'") = 0 
				cChar = "'"
			else 
				cChar = "`"
			}
		return cChar + cValue + cChar

	By using : Check if we have "string" or 'string' or `string`
	
	So After solving the original error I updated the function to

	func ValueAsString cValue
		# Add " " or ' ' or ` `
			if substr(cValue,'"') = 0 {
				cChar = '"'
			elseif substr(cValue,"'") = 0 
				cChar = "'"
			else 
				cChar = "`"
			}
		return cChar + cValue + cChar
