===============================================================================
* Disable the block Style for comments (Empty Lines, Images)
* A way to learn programming (Video Lessons, Tutorials, Tests) 
* A way to share and download apps (Package Manager)
=====[Arabic Version]==========================================================
* Goal Designer - Support the Border Style
* Form Designer - Controls Names (Button1, Label1, etc.)
* Form Designer - Colors Names (Black, White, etc.)
* Form Designer - Templates (Controller)
* Classes - Methods Names (Arabic Translation)
* Ring2PWCT - Support the Arabic Keywords
=====[PWCT For WebAssembly]==================================================== 
* Set default style for the steps tree
* Avoid (Menubar - Apperance - Main File ToolBar)
* Avoid (Project Files Window)
* When we are in FullScreen and click interact - Raise the Components Browser
* Avoid error when we click (MenuBar-View-OutputWindow)
* When we run a program, always clear the output, even if no-output 
* Time Machine - Play As Movie
* Steps Tree - Header Width 
* Give Command - Getting Input (Problem in Qt itself) 
	--> Should be solved in Qt 6.3
* Uploading Many Files 
* Filtering Components - Removing Database Components 
* Form Designer - Remove Unsupported Controls
* Fast Startup
==[PWCT For Mobile]============================================================
* Update the embedded StdLib & GUILib

* Steps Tree - Labels - Don't receive mouse events to allow scrolling 
* Filtering Components - Remove unsupported components 
* Form Designer - Remove Unsupported Controls
* Form Designer - Color/Font Dialogs - Window Width
* Form Designer - Properties - Column Width
* Restore style after running apps that change the style
* Prevent closing PWCT when an app uses QAPP.Close()
* Merge Samples/Applications with the App Package
* Fast Startup 
==[Things to do in the Future ]================================================
* Steps Tree - Drag and Drop
* Expression Component Add Literal/Literal&Comma instead of using Free Typing
* Change generated code to use Ring-FirstStyle instead of Ring-ThirdStyle
* Wizards (To quickly create data screen, etc)
* Suggestions of commands based on controls in form designer and steps tree 
* Quick tasks, think of components as commands
* Add a command window to create visual programs using natural commands
* Support for other programming languages 
* Support Extensions (Adding components to VPLs)
* Visual Compiler
* Read Mode (remove leaf nodes)
* Goal Designer - Do Operation on Many Steps (Instead of Goal Viewer)
* Goal Designer - Adding Video/Voice in the Steps Tree
* Components - Support different Ring code styles in the generated code
* Game of Programming (A game to learn programming using PWCT way!)
* PWCT For Mobile - Use QML to (Browse Internet, Play Video, etc)
* Improving Performance ---> Opening large files
* Improving Performance ---> Opening all of the interaction pages in one shot
* Improving Performance ---> Chaning styles while opening large files
* Readable Files without Visual Environment (Using Any code editor)
