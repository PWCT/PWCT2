# These are two functions made to extract the integer and decimal parts
# from a number: integerPart(n) and decimalPart(n,nRound)
#
# Note that you need to specify the round of the number you
# provide to decimalpar() function to protect the number against
# the active round defined by decimals() function.
#
# To get the active round, you use the getActiveRound() function.
#
# The logic used by these functions for extracting the integer and
# the decimal parts is not mathematical, but based on walking throw
# the number as a string and finding the "." separator.

? integerPart(n)	# Gives 123456789
? getActiveRound()	# Gives 0, because the integerPart has set the active round to 0

? n	# Gives only the intger part of n (123456789), because the round has been set to 0
? decimalPart(n,5)	# Now, we pass the n value but by specifying 5 as number of decimals
			# Then we get 0.12345

? getActiveRound()	# Actually, the active round has been set to 5

// NB: In all code you would write, you should get the active round befor you do anything
// so you are not suprised when they have changed elswhere.
