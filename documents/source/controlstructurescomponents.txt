In this chapter we are going to learn about the Control Structures Components

.. index:: 
	pair: Control Structures Components; Introduction

Introduction
============

These components could be used to take decisions and separate the execution to different branches where one of these brances will be executed based on the evaluation result of specific conditions

Also it can be used to repeat the execution of specific commands

We have many components in this category:

* If Statement

* Else If
* Switch
* Case
* Else (Other)
* For Loop
* For In Loop
* While Loop
* Do Again Loop
* Try Catch
* Exit Command
* Loop Command
