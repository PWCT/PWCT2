===============

When we run PWCT, The Main Window present the next dockable windows

2 - Each component could provide an Interaction Page (Data-Entry Window) 

3 - The Component lead the steps generation process in the Steps Tree (Inside the Goal Designer)

4 - The Component also generate the Textual source code in the background

Form Designer
-------------

Using the Form Designer, We can design the application forms (User Interface)

For example, The User Interface of the Desktop Screen Shot application is designed using the Form Designer

Output Window
------------- 

Using the Output Window, We can see the programs output!

Also we can provide the required input for console applications

For example, The next console application ask about the User Name!

We can type the name in the Textbox then press (Enter) or click on the (Send) button

1 - Contains the Steps Tree that represent the logic behind our program

2 - Contains buttons that we can use to control the steps tree

3 - Contains the Time Machine

3.1 - Support running the program in the past

3.2 - Support playing the program as movie

	pair: Getting Started; Hello World Program (Using the Mouse)

Hello World Program (Using the Mouse)
=====================================


From the Components Browser, Select the (Print Text) component

Then double click using the Mouse

.. image:: images/helloworld/p1.png
	:alt: p1.png

After selecting the component, an interaction page will appears in the Goal Designer

Using this Interaction Page we can determine the text that will be printed on the screen

Type: Hello, World!

Then click the (Ok) button

.. image:: images/helloworld/p2.png
	:alt: p2.png

This will generate the next step in the Goal Designer Window

.. image:: images/helloworld/p3.png

Now we can run the program and see the program output

To run the program click on the (Run) button from the Main Toolbar

.. image:: images/helloworld/p4.png

The next output will appears in the Output Window

Hello World Program (Steps Summary)
-----------------------------------

1. Select (Print Text) from the Components Browser
2. Enter (Hello, World!) then click (Ok) in the Interaction Page
3. Click (Run) from the Main Toolbar

.. image:: images/concept/hello.png

.. index:: 
	pair: Getting Started; Hello World Program (Using the Keyboard)

Hello World Program (Using the Keyboard)
========================================

* Inside the Goal Designer window press the letter 'p'
* Pressing any letter inside the Goal Designer will move us to the Components Browser
* The Search Textbox will be active, and the pressed letter will be written there
* This will select the (Print Text) component
* Press (Enter) to use the (Print Text) Component
* Write (Hello, World!) then press CTRL+W (Similar to clicking on the OK button)

.. index:: 
	pair: Getting Started; Copy & Paste the Steps

Copy & Paste the Steps
======================

Select the step (Print Hello, World!) then click on the (Copy) button or press Ctrl+C

.. image:: images/helloworld/copypaste1.png
	:alt: copypaste1.png

Now select the Start Point then click on the (Paste) button or press Ctrl+V

.. image:: images/helloworld/copypaste2.png
	:alt: copypaste2.png

We can do the paste operation many times

.. image:: images/helloworld/copypaste3.png
	:alt: copypaste3.png

Now when we run the program using Ctrl+F5 we can see the (Hello, World!) message printed seven times

Sure it's not the right way to program something this because it's better to use a For-Loop
