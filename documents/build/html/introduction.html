<img alt="The PWCT Visual Programming Language" src="_images/pwctdoclogo.jpg" />
<p>Welcome to the PWCT visual programming language!</p>
<p>PWCT is a visual programming language that focuses on Productivity and Ease-of-Use!</p>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to learn programming, create applications/systems or get some new ideas
about visual programming in the practice then you are in the right place. The goal
of this project is to present programming to every computer users, whether they are
beginners or professionals. Beginners means that the tools of programming must be
accessible – must be easy. So I decided to take coding out of programming. And
presenting programming to professional developers requires a tool that is productive
and unlimited and can be extended.</p>
<p>The domain of the problem is called “Visual Programming Languages.” There are many
projects in this domain, but most of these languages are domain-specific languages
that are used in education, But with respect to general-purpose visual programming
languages, there are few of them. PWCT don’t use the Drag-and-Drop method. PWCT
provide a new method based on Automatic Steps Tree Generation and Update in
response to interaction with components that provide to the user simple
data entry forms. The idea behind this new method is to mix between
programming using Diagrammatic approach and programming using Form-based
approach where the integration between the two approaches are done
seamlessly through an Automatic Visual Representation Generation process.
This is just the basic idea and many other ideas are developed around
this concept to get a practical general purpose visual programming
language for real world tasks.</p>

Instead it lets your focus your attention on solving the problem. It also standardizes errors for debugging your program. A lot of work went into this project. “</strong></div>

I dont think anything is more worth to made coding such faster ,easy and visualize. its just incredible and future of coding …………. so good luck for future to change the coding technology and hence change the world of coding ……hence entire universe………… the spreading or marketing can change whole education industry and coding technology…. thank you “</strong></div>
