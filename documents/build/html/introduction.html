<img alt="The PWCT Visual Programming Language" src="_images/pwctdoclogo.jpg" />
<p>Welcome to the PWCT visual programming language!</p>
<p>If you want to learn programming, create applications/systems or get some new ideas
about visual programming in the practice then you are in the right place. The goal
of this project is to present programming to every computer users, whether they are
beginners or professionals. Beginners means that the tools of programming must be
accessible – must be easy. So I decided to take coding out of programming. And
presenting programming to professional developers requires a tool that is productive
and unlimited and can be extended.</p>
<p>The domain of the problem is called “Visual Programming Languages.” There are many
projects in this domain, but most of these languages are domain-specific languages
that are used in education, But with respect to general-purpose visual programming
languages, there are few of them. PWCT don’t use the Drag-and-Drop method. PWCT
provide a new method based on Automatic Steps Tree Generation and Update in
response to interaction with components that provide to the user simple
data entry forms. The idea behind this new method is to mix between
programming using Diagrammatic approach and programming using Form-based
approach where the integration between the two approaches are done
seamlessly through an Automatic Visual Representation Generation process.
This is just the basic idea and many other ideas are developed around
this concept to get a practical general purpose visual programming
language for real world tasks.</p>
<p>In this chapter we are going to discuss the goals behind the language design and implementation.</p>

<h2>The First Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="the-concept-of-the-first-generation">
<h2>The Concept of The First Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-concept-of-the-first-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fifteen years ago (In Dec. 2005) I started to think about developing PWCT.</p>
<p>I started with many ideas and I tested each idea through practical development</p>
<p>In 2007, The core idea was very simple (Goal Designer instead of Code Editor)</p>
<p>We see this in the next screen shot, Instead of writing textual code directly, we follow
a procedure of four simple steps</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Select a component</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the data required for this component</p></li>
<li><p>Interact with the steps tree (If you need this)</p></li>
<li><p>Run the program</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The next diagram demonstrates something similar to what I wrote using a pen and paper to explain the idea to my
friends (The diagram uses screen shots from PWCT 2.0 that doesn’t exist at that time).</p>
<img alt="Hello" src="_images/Hello.png" />
<p>At that time, the advantages were very clear</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Selecting components means we can explore the programming system and start using it without previous knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Separating data from instructions through the data-entry forms provide the ability for quick reuse</p></li>
<li><p>Using a GUI to program means easy support for translation (Arabic, English, French, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>No Syntax Errors (Happy experience for beginners)</p></li>
<li><p>The generated steps tree (instead of source code) provides a chance for Maximum Readability</p></li>
<li><p>The generated steps could replace many lines of source code (Higher Abstraction)</p></li>
<li><p>The generated steps could be in many locations at the same time</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction with a tree (Steps Tree) provide the ability to control many nodes (Parent &amp; Children) together (Faster)</p></li>
<li><p>The same component could generate different steps based on the data that we enter through data-entry forms</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This design was enough to attract a few thouands of developers until 2009</p>
<p>from 2009 to 2013, We improved the system with the next features</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Using Keyboard Shortcuts to improve the writability</p></li>
<li><p>Adding Colors &amp; Customization to the Steps Tree</p></li>
<li><p>Improving a domain-specific language that are used for developing the components</p></li>
<li><p>Supporting more programming languages in the code generation layer</p></li>
<li><p>Show/Hide steps based on the context</p></li>
<li><p>Two modes (Syntax Directed Editor OR Free Editor + VPL Compiler)</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic Documentation (Generate HTML Files from Visual Programs)</p></li>
<li><p>Optional automatic update of programs after components update</p></li>
<li><p>Adding the Time Dimension</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Using the Time Dimension we can</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Move to a point in the past during development and run the program</p></li>
<li><p>Play programs as movies to learn how to create a program step by step</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the next program print numbers from 1 to 10 and print the Three message after the number 3.</p>
<img alt="Time Machine 1" src="_images/tm1.png" />
<p>Using the Time Machine slider, we can move to the past and run the program before adding the if statement that print the Three message.</p>
<img alt="Time Machine 2" src="_images/tm2.png" />
<p>The previous screen shots uses PWCT 2.0 but, the same idea is implemented in the first generation of PWCT from 2011 (PWCT 1.8)</p>
<p>These updates were enough to attract hundered thousands of developers to download the product and try it!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-disadvantages-of-the-first-generation">
<h2>The Disadvantages of the First Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-disadvantages-of-the-first-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It’s all about the implementation and the missing features!</p>
<p>The concept is very good, that attracted many developers with different background and they started asking about many things!</p>
<p>And Yes! some developers asked about improving the concept itself! (More innovation is required)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Some developers reported that using Code Editors is too much flexibile and faster in some situtations</p></li>
<li><p>Slow performance when using large visual source files</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Source Files are database files (not textual) which is not good for Version Control software</p></li>
<li><p>Support importing the source code (Convert source code files to Visual Source Files)</p></li>
<li><p>Opening many files and quick nagivation</p></li>
<li><p>Multiplatform support (Windows, Linux &amp; macOS)</p></li>
<li><p>Support Web &amp; Mobile development</p></li>
<li><p>Support more programming languages</p></li>
<li><p>Translation &amp; Unicode</p></li>
<li><p>Modern Form Designer</p></li>
<li><p>Support powerful libraries and frameworks</p></li>
<li><p>More educational resources!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I started to think about all of these issues and feature requests and how I can implement them.</p>
<p>I discovered that I need a new programming language (Ring) that could help me to do all of this in an efficient way</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-second-generation">
<h2>The Second Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The second generation (PWCT 2.0) is under development using the Ring programming language</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a more powerful version of the software that satisfy two conditions</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>To be an easy tool to start learning about real programming concepts</p></li>
<li><p>To be a better replacement for Textual Code Editors</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the first generation we tried to achive the same goals but, we did a lot of mistakes, we
learned from them and developed new ideas then we implemented these ideas in PWCT 2.0</p>
<p>I could be brave and say that after PWCT 2.0 development, I don’t see any reason to use a Textual Code Editor
when developing Ring applications. The same could be applied for other textual programming languages when we
support them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improving-the-concept">
<h2>Improving the Concept<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-the-concept" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>1- The Ring textual language is designed for high writability</p>
<p>2- The PWCT visual language is designed for high readability</p>
<p>3- We can use them together at the same time using (Ring2PWCT)</p>
<p>3.1 - We can write Ring code directly and get the Visual Representation</p>
<p>3.2 - We can import textual source code files and complete projects written in Ring</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interactive-visualizations">
<h2>Interactive Visualizations<a class="headerlink" href="#interactive-visualizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the Goal Designer we can type Ring code directly and PWCT will do the visualization</p>
<p>The next Ring code create an object and a class in one line.</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 1" src="_images/ft1.png" />
<p>We get the visual output in the Steps Tree</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 2" src="_images/ft2.png" />
<p>We can continue and write more code, for example using a (For Loop) and (If statement)</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 3" src="_images/ft3.png" />
<p>Again, we see the output in the steps tree</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 4" src="_images/ft4.png" />
<p>We can define three functions (one, two &amp; three)</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 5" src="_images/ft5.png" />
<p>The steps tree are updated</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 6" src="_images/ft6.png" />
<p>We can call these functions</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 7" src="_images/ft7.png" />
<p>So, if you are a Ring programmer and know how to write textual Code, You can reuse this knowledge and PWCT will not get in your way!</p>
<img alt="Fast Typing 8" src="_images/ft8.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-textual-source-code-files">
<h2>Import Textual Source Code Files<a class="headerlink" href="#import-textual-source-code-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PWCT 2.0 comes with Ring2PWCT that can import any textual source code file.</p>
<p>We imported all of the Ring applications and samples</p>
<p>For example the next screen shots for the Flappy Bird 3000 game</p>
<img alt="Flappy Bird1" src="_images/flappybird1.png" />
<img alt="Flappy Bird2" src="_images/flappybird2.png" />

<div class="section" id="improving-the-implementation">
<h2>Improving the Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-the-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the second generation of PWCT, we worked on solving all of the reported problems in the design and implementation of the first generation. Also we implemented most feature requests that are useful and improve the flexibility of the product.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bit-version">
<h2>64-bit version<a class="headerlink" href="#bit-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PWCT 2.0 will comes with 64-bit version (no longer limited to ~4gb of memory)</p>
<p>### Open Many Files</p>
<p>PWCT 2.0 Support opening many visual source files at the same time</p>
<img alt="Open Many Files" src="_images/openmanyfiles.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="inserting-steps">
<h2>Inserting Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#inserting-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PWCT 2.0 support starting new interactions at any location in the steps tree (Not just Start Here steps)</p>
<p>The new steps will be inserted in the right location</p>
<p>This feature is supported while using components, Ring2PWCT and Paste operations</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="auto-complete">
<h2>Auto-Complete<a class="headerlink" href="#auto-complete" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In PWCT 2.0 Interaction Pages, we have better usability through default values, search in listboxes and better
auto-complete.</p>
<img alt="Auto-Complete" src="_images/autocomplete.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-and-mobile-versions">
<h2>Web and Mobile versions<a class="headerlink" href="#web-and-mobile-versions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can use PWCT on Desktop, Web &amp; Mobile platforms.</p>
<p>The next screen shot for the Mobile &amp; Web versions</p>
<p>The Web version uses (Qt For WebAssembly) and the Mobile version uses (Qt for Android)</p>
<p>Most software developers uses the Desktop platforms and I belive that this is too much
better and practical. but we added the support to these platforms for two reasons</p>
<p>1- We can easily support them (Thanks to the powerful Ring language &amp; Qt framework)</p>
<p>2- At some situations, these platforms are very useful.</p>
<p>2.1 - Some Users don’t have Desktop computers but have Mobile devices.</p>
<p>2.2 - At some places we could have only our Mobile devices and some free time for programming.</p>
<p>The Mobile screen is small, typing using the touch screen is slow
compared to using a large keyboard.</p>
<p>Using foldable smartphones and Tablets provide better experience.</p>

<div class="section" id="translation-arabic-version">
<h2>Translation (Arabic Version)<a class="headerlink" href="#translation-arabic-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the advantages of using Visual Programming and GUI over textual code editors is the easy translation of these User Interfaces to other natural languages.</p>
<p>PWCT 2.0 will comes with an Arabic version, other languages could be added in the future.</p>
