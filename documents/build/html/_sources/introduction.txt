PWCT is a visual programming language that focuses on Productivity and Ease-of-Use! 

If you want to learn programming, create applications/systems or get some new ideas
about visual programming in the practice then you are in the right place. The goal
of this project is to present programming to every computer users, whether they are
beginners or professionals. Beginners means that the tools of programming must be
accessible â€“ must be easy. So I decided to take coding out of programming. And 
presenting programming to professional developers requires a tool that is productive
and unlimited and can be extended. 

The domain of the problem is called "Visual Programming Languages." There are many
projects in this domain, but most of these languages are domain-specific languages
that are used in education, But with respect to general-purpose visual programming
languages, there are few of them. PWCT don't use the Drag-and-Drop method. PWCT 
provide a new method based on Automatic Steps Tree Generation and Update in 
response to interaction with components that provide to the user simple 
data entry forms. The idea behind this new method is to mix between 
programming using Diagrammatic approach and programming using Form-based 
approach where the integration between the two approaches are done 
seamlessly through an Automatic Visual Representation Generation process. 
This is just the basic idea and many other ideas are developed around 
this concept to get a practical general purpose visual programming 
language for real world tasks.

Quotes about PWCT
=================

|	**"Programming language masterpiece! I have to develop an educational software for my PhD Thesis and i haven't the time to learn a coding language now. Thumbs up for Mahmoud Samir Fayed and his research team. "**
|		, jslafas (Sourceforge)

|	**"This is great for making applications. I am a beginner who is still learning but with a few tutorial videos i'm sure i'll get the hang of it soon enough"**
|		, jamesh101 (Sourceforge)

|	**"This Project is best way to learn programming"**
|		, eternel0422 (Sourceforge)

|	**"This is a great tool for development and strives to remove many of the problems coding with text based languages. It aides you in putting your program logic together and does not force you to use one style of programming (OO, procedural, event and others). Instead it lets your focus your attention on solving the problem. It also standardizes errors for debugging your program. A lot of work went into this project. "**
|		, c_horne (Sourceforge)

|	**"Nice implementation and interface. And it seems that it has many possibilities!! "**
|		, stavros68 (Sourceforge)

|	**"Nice Concept Keep Developing it!!!"**
|		, aryaputrasrj  (Sourceforge)

|	**"Some years ago I tried to use programming tool also without coding(it used block-like structure), but I was dissapointed. But this tool is amazing!!! I can say that it is really alternative to coding! "**
|		, bettinaf1986  (Sourceforge)

|	**"I can agree with most of this reviews: this project is great! "**
|		, davidshwinders   (Sourceforge)

|	**"Very smooth and non intrusive interface. "**
|		, revenajs1983 (Sourceforge)

|	**"Really great project for newbies and noobs who doesn't know programming skills. "**
|		, annhouge  (Sourceforge)

|	**"Very, very light program, and fully featured. "**
|		, congworlniros (Sourceforge)

|	**"Version to evaluate , like supernova 1.3 , this tool could be the last word in human computer interaction , no more difference Java and Visual Basic , my word is equal to a computer command . The best idea I've seen . "**
|		,  oid-3753088 (Sourceforge)

|	**"Mahmoud Fayed, I have started used your Programming Without Coding Technology.Its just incredible to use your application and your programming language, I dont think anything is more worth to made this Programming Without Coding Technology . I dont think anything is more worth to made coding to beginners like me and to the common people. I dont think anything is more worth to made coding such faster ,easy and visualize. its just incredible and future of coding ............. so good luck for future to change the coding technology and hence change the world of coding ......hence entire universe............ the spreading or marketing can change whole education industry and coding technology.... thank you "**
