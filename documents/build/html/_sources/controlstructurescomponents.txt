Control Structures Components
=============================

In this chapter we are going to learn about the Control Structures Components

.. index:: 
	pair: Control Structures Components; Introduction

Introduction
============

These components could be used to take decisions and separate the execution to different branches where one of these brances will be executed based on the evaluation result of specific conditions

Also it can be used to repeat the execution of specific commands

We have many components in this category:

* If Statement
* Else 
* Else If
* Switch
* Case
* Else (Other)
* For Loop
* For In Loop
* While Loop
* Do Again Loop
* Try Catch
* Exit Command
* Loop Command

.. index:: 
	pair: Control Structures Components; If Statement

If Statement
============

In the Interaction Page we can determine the Condition

.. image:: images/controlstructurescomponents/ib_controlstructures_ifstatement.png
        :alt: If Statement


For example, if the condition is (x=1) the next steps will be generated in the Steps Tree

        :alt: If Statement

Sure, This is not a complete program, and will lead to runtime error because the x variable is not defined!

.. index:: 
	pair: Control Structures Components; Else

Else
====

Using (Else) We can determine what to do if the (If Statement & Else If Statements) conditions are not True 

.. image:: images/controlstructurescomponents/ib_controlstructures_else.png
        :alt: Else

Example:

.. image:: images/controlstructurescomponents/ib_controlstructures_else2.png
        :alt: Else


.. index:: 
	pair: Control Structures Components; Else If

Else If
=======

Using many (Else If) statements, we can evaluate different conditions 

In the Interaction Page we can determine the condition

.. image:: images/controlstructurescomponents/ib_controlstructures_elseif.png
        :alt: Else If

In the next example, We have the X variable and we use (If Statement) and (Else if) statements to determine what to do based on the variable value

        :alt: Else If
